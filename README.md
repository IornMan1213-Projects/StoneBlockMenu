Welcome this is the WIP StoneBlock /menu recreation project!

ETA SON

* To-Do list:
* finalize main page (HTML.html)
* Finalize Machines (Machines.html)
* Finalize Use (USE.html)
* Start work on Items & Materials (Items&Materials.html)
* Start work on Miscellaneous (Miscellaneous.html)
* Start work on Tools & Armor (Tools&Armor.html)
* Cry in CSS 
* *Maybe* Re-do this entire project to make a Macos, Linux, and Windows executable. (The only reason this would be made is so that you could access it without internet, which is kinda pointless but it'll be a fun project :) )
